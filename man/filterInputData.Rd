    Filter Data Rows and Subset Data Columns
}
\description{
    Given a data frame with a column containing receptor sequences, filter data
    rows by sequence length and sequence content. Keep all data columns or choose
    which columns to keep.
}
\usage{
filterInputData(
  data,
  seq_col,
  min_seq_length = NULL,
  drop_matches = NULL,
  subset_cols = NULL,
  count_col = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
    A data frame.
}
  \item{seq_col}{
    Specifies the column(s) of \code{data} containing
    the receptor sequences.
    Accepts a character or numeric vector of length 1 or 2,
      containing either column names or column indices.
    Each column specified will be coerced
    to a character vector. Data rows containing a value of \code{NA} in any
    of the specified columns will be dropped.
}
  \item{min_seq_length}{
    Observations whose receptor sequences have fewer than \code{min_seq_length}
    characters are dropped.
}
  \item{drop_matches}{
    Accepts a character string containing a regular expression
    (see \code{\link[base]{regex}}). Checks values in the receptor sequence
    column for a pattern match using \code{\link[=grep]{grep()}}.
    Rows in which a match is found are dropped.
}
  \item{subset_cols}{
    Specifies which columns of the AIRR-Seq data are included in the output.
    Accepts a character vector of column names
    or a numeric vector of column indices.
    The default
    \code{NULL} includes all columns. The receptor sequence column is always
    included regardless of this argument's value.
}
  \item{count_col}{
  Optional. Specifies the column of \code{data} containing a measure of abundance,
    e.g., clone count or unique molecular identifier (UMI) count. Accepts either
    the column name as a character string or the numeric column index.
    If provided, data rows with \code{NA} count values will be removed.
}
  \item{verbose}{
      Logical. If \code{TRUE}, generates messages about the tasks
      performed and their progress, as well as relevant properties of intermediate
      outputs. Messages are sent to \code{\link[=stderr]{stderr()}}.
  }
}
\value{
    A data frame.
